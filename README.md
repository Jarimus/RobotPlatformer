# RobotPlatformer

This was the final assignment for a Python Programming Course (https://programming-24.mooc.fi/) that I took part in fall 2024.
We were given a few images (a monster, robot, coin and a door) and one example (a sokoban game), and free reign to do whatever we want with them!

This was the outcome after maybe 30ish hours of coding? There are a few glitches here and there, and there are things I would like to expand upon, but this will have to do!
